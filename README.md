# predict-drug-response-of-cancer-celllines

To use gene expression data to predict drug response of cancer cells.

Attached you will find a (csv) dataset including gene expression signature of cancer cell line and two alternative drug response variables for Paclitaxel. The goal is to train an ML method that uses gene expression features to predict the AUC – the area under the fitted dose response curve, or the IC50 – the concentration at which the compound reaches 50% reduction in cell viability.
Implement a typical ML workflow in R or Python, including the following steps: data preparation/cleaning and visualization, training/validation, model selection and evaluation. Note: you can apply any ML technique including dimensionality reduction/feature reduction techniques.
